# 🎓 Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **CampusX Machine Learning Learning Repository!**  
This repository contains my **hands-on practice notebooks, notes, and experiments** as I learn Machine Learning step by step from the CampusX course.

---

## 🌟 Objective

The goal of this repository is to document my **continuous learning journey** in Data Science and Machine Learning.  
Each notebook demonstrates:
- The **concept** I learned
- The **Python implementation** using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
- The **key takeaways and visualizations** that helped me understand the concept better

I’ll be updating this repository regularly as I complete new modules and projects from CampusX.
